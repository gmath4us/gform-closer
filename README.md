# Auto-Close Google Form via Apps Script

Simple Apps Script that allows you to auto-close a Google Form without the need for a 3rd party add-on.

All you have to do is:
1. add a script to your current form
2. copy/paste the code from my project
3. edit ```FORM_ID``` ([line 22](https://github.com/neojato/gform-closer/blob/main/Code.gs#L22)) 
4. edit ```FORM_CLOSE_DATE``` ([line 25](https://github.com/neojato/gform-closer/blob/main/Code.gs#L25))
5. Save and run the "Initialize" function
    1. This auto-creates a trigger to run the script for you on the date/time you entered

Why would you use this script and not an add-on?
1. you can see what it actually does
2. it isn't written by an unknown 3rd party :)
